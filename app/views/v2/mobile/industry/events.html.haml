            come rain or shine
          %p Our first 12 years we took our thousands strong talent pool across the UK working major festivals and bespoke events. We grew as the industry evolved and steadily became one of the go-to festival staffing provider, known for providing the complete event staff management package – never understaffed and handling all logistics.
          %p Today, the huge variety of events we now staff from 'boutique' to mass sports has enabled us to grow an enviable database of people accustomed to the rigours of ever-changing weather, working long hours and flexible interesting work.
          %p We can lock in many of our staff months in advance – or often at the drop of a hat. If you need experienced events staff, we can help.

          %p Having previously staffed one V Festival several times, we knew handling both sites would be a monumental task. We jumped right in with diligent planning, recruiting and organising more than 750 bar staff, managers and supervisors. That’s 48 different bar teams, 12 shift patterns, nine coaches and five big local recruitment days. And all before smartphones!
          .see-content
            %p Our well-polished process meant that for the next 10-years, both V sites had full bar teams that simply arrived and worked. Our unique 360-degree festival service operated flawlessly alongside our clients’ operations and we proved time and time again that we can be adaptable in any field.
