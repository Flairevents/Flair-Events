          %p Flair can deliver experienced teams of great workers for sporting events of all sizes, and we’ll put in all the prep to ensure that everyone is firing on all cylinders. Finding skilled stewards and marshals for sports events has been one of our core areas of business for almost 20 years. Our teams cover Triathlons, Duathlons, Trailblazers, Colour Runs, Marathons and more.
          %p What makes us different is our people. Many of them come from sports backgrounds and have been with us through storms, snow and heatwaves in city centres to mountainsides for years. We know how to seamlessly integrate our people with your own, and can assist with everything from training to logistics, scheduling and deployment.
