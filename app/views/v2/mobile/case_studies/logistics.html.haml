      %h2 Key challenge:
      %p Just before Christmas, our client urgently needed to start opening local authority test centres to assist in the struggle against the spread of Covid-19. We were given 30hrs notice to start delivering teams of competent and committed people who could work 12-hour shifts covering seven days a week. Everyone had to have DBS checks and needed to complete six NHS training modules before attending.

      %h2 How we helped:
      %p The importance of helping our client to open the test sites is hard to overestimate. We didn’t quite cancel Christmas, but we immediately set about recruiting the first group of 72 people we needed. Our London database didn’t disappoint, and we found many candidates willing to offer their skills and commitment. We quickly grew our pool of candidates to an impressive 200 people able to cover the initial weeks.
      %p To add more spice to the brief, all staff had to have valid DBS checks, to work 12-hour shifts in strict cohort bubbles and they each needed to pass six NHS training modules before their first shift. The quick turnaround meant that the client’s requirements were evolving even as teams were on the ground working. Our reaction time – enhanced by Flair's scheduling app – meant information was relayed quickly, and our client’s requirements were constantly met.
      %p The initial request turned from weeks into months, and our flexible on-demand staffing teams shifted to full-time temping jobs. We reacted once more, turning to our database and actively seeking new people to supply a seamless daily service.
