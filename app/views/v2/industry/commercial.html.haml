            %p.mt3 We speak your language when you tell us you need customer service reps, retail assistants, call centre agents, people to capture data and front desk greeters. From flexible on the day requirements to strategically-planned upcoming incentives.
            %p.mt1 Our database is constantly being updated – meaning that as well as finding staff for more traditional positions, we can also find people for newer, more nuanced roles.
            %p.mt1 We’ve helped big names such as Ebay, Stubhub, Tesco and Eventbrite to find workers who will complement their existing culture. This is a key goal at Flair, as great teams tend to emerge when skills and personalities match up.

              Flair made the staffing of our Netball World Cup merchandise operations super easy and stress free. As an Australian- based company needing more than 400 shifts filled over 15 days, we didn't need the hassle of recruitment or payroll. Flair’s staff and crew were expertly selected and turned up ready to work long busy days behind the busy merchandise tills. C2C Sports would definitely use the Flair team again.

            %p.mt2 A major ticketing centre needed ‘top up crew’ to meet spikes in demand. Our workers would need to know the company’s system, standards, and protocols – plus blend in with a permanent team. Key to our success was finding flexible local people who would accept the unpredictable nature of the contract. Honesty being the best policy to build loyalty for us and our clients, we gathered together a pool of experienced call centre staff who understood the need for flexibility. This, and our reaction time, made it a success.
            %p.mt1 We met targets and saved our clients valuable time by outsourcing recruitment. Continuous feedback minimised the chances of surprises, with all stakeholders kept in the loop. Workers were valued, felt included and enjoyed the flexibility the contract offered.
