INSTALLING SSL Certificate

in flair/certs (dev machine):

	●	Copy downloaded certificate files into a folder named after the current year

  ● Cat together the certificates (or as instructed by the certificate vendor) into certs/public_chained.crt
	  ie. cat ssl_certificate.cer IntermediateCA.cer > ../public_chained.crt

    Note: We don't need to change the public key. We use the same one to generate the csr each time.

	●	commit, push and deploy
